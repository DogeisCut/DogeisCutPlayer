uhhh it does stuff this is a very awesome readme

i am currently trying to re-create every midi instrument, so contributions are very welcome and encouraged

i am also currently trying to optimise the script (mostly read_midi_raw_to_table() and where its used) to allow it to work on at least high permissions
